			<h3>Data analyst/SEO Professional</h3>
			<p>
				Daniel Gebreselassie is a Data Analyst/SEO out of Seattle, Washington. Daniel Gebreselassie was employed in the construction industry for the last decade. His journey through this field began with completing a 600 hour course at Seattle Vocational Institute in which he was taught the basic concepts and industry standards while aquiring multiple relevant certifications. Upon graduation he entered the workforce first as a part of a small local home remodel company, than as a member of local 30 Carpenters union. The pandemic caused Daniel, like many others to re-evaluate his career choice and motivate him to pursue further education and magnified a desire to aquire a skillset more suited to a rapidly techifying (is that even a word?) Job Market. He enrolled in the web development program at Seattle Central College And is exploring obtaining other field and industry relevant certificates. His time in the construction field has taught him many things but 2 things stand out. One, that every project requires teamwork and communicaton between the various trades. Second that a jack of all trades is a master of none. The beginning of something is almost is always the most exciting because it holds the most possible outcomes and Daniel is excited to begin his journey, both educationally and professionally.

                <p>Eddie is an aspiring web developer born and raised in Seattle, Wa. Eddie's career began while working for a locally-owned pottery shop. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the shop found a new need for a robust online storefront. With only a little coding experience and a lot of confidence in their googling skills, Eddie worked with the owner to create a new e-commerce site for the store. In doing this, they discovered a passion for web development and a desire to support small buisness.<br>In order to further their skills, Eddie left a four-year university for the more focused two-year web development program at Seattle Central. They hope to become a front-end web developer, and use thier skills to help small businesses create the website of their dreams. In their spare time, Eddie enjoys sewing, playing tabletop games, and generally any activity that involves being a huge nerd with their friends and family.</p>

			<h3>UX Designer</h3>
			<p>
				Edwin Guevara is a UX Designer based out of Seattle, WA. For the past year, he has worked with Reef Cannabis to redesign their e-commerce site. As the sole UX designer, he managed the project from research to production. With a team of developers and key stakeholders throughout the process to troubleshoot along the way. Before making a career change into UX, Edwin worked in the nonprofit sector for nearly a decade. He worked in various roles, most recently as IT Project Manager at the Seattle Art Museum. In this role, he worked with developers and designers on the museum's website and exhibits. While the position was cut short due to the pandemic, he found the experience life-changing.</p>
				<p>He promptly enrolled in the User Experience Certificate program at the School of Visual Concepts and the Web Design Associates program at Seattle Central College. As a project manager, he saw the value of learning code and design, which inspired him to return to school. But it was his career in the nonprofits that taught him the power of empathy and clear communication. Edwin is an excellent asset to any team because of his love for collaboration and his background in project management.  His experience as a PM means that he can communicate with developers and designers and think about the bigger picture. At the same time, his background in nonprofits makes him empathetic and understanding of the needs of users. He is eager to continue to learn and grow, working along with great designers.
